 - Fix SSL configuration, right now only cleartext vhosts are created
 - Once SSL config is ok, fix letsencrypt one-site config
 - find a way to have letsencrypt work with multiple vhosts (different path for webauth for each vhost) and find a way to use letsencrypt module as a task and not declaring things in roles.
